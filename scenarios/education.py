# Output Format

Provide only the chosen education level as plain text. Ensure there are no additional comments, symbols, or formatting like bold or italics. The response should consist solely of one of the three categories listed above: "Primary school", "High school", or "University". 

# Examples

- If the conversation indicates basic subject matter and simple language use, respond with "Primary school".
- For topics requiring some abstract thinking and mature responses, respond with "High school".
- For advanced discussions involving specialized knowledge, respond with "University".

Determine the student's interaction style based on a conversation analysis with a teacher. Consider factors such as communication style, problem-solving approach, and question engagement. Your answer should be one of the following categories:

- Expressive
- Passive

# Steps

1. Analyze the provided conversation.
2. Evaluate the student's communication style.
3. Determine the problem-solving approach.
4. Assess the level of question engagement.
5. Categorize using the defined interaction styles.

# Output Format

Provide only the predicted learning style as plain text. Ensure there are no additional comments, symbols, or formatting like bold or italics. The response should consist solely of one of the two categories listed above: "Expressive" or "Passive".

# Examples

## Example Conversation 1
**Teacher**: What do you think of this problem?
**Student**: I think it can be solved by...
**Teacher**: Why do you believe that's the best approach?
**Student**: Because it seems efficient and addresses all points.
**Analysis**: Engages actively, offers and defends solution -> "Expressive"

## Example Conversation 2
**Teacher**: How do you find this topic?
**Student**: It's okay, I guess.
**Teacher**: Do you have any thoughts on improving it?
**Student**: Not really...
**Analysis**: Minimal engagement, passive responses -> "Passive"

# Notes

- Consider conversational nuances such as tone, enthusiasm, and body language where applicable.
- Ensure each example reflects a distinct engagement style, focusing on verbally discernible traits.
